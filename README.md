### Reflection 
This was a 1 week long project built during my second module at Moringa School of Software Development. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.

Originally I wanted to build an application that allowed users to search for various words form the dictionary API and get the meanings back.  I started this process by using the `create-react-app` boilerplate, then adding `Materialui` and `bootstrap`.
